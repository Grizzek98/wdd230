        <h1>Lidekonia Chamber of Commerce Target Audience</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>This site is meant to target small business owners and non-profit organizations within the Lidekonia area, as well
            as any other organizations that will mutually benefit the business ecosystem as a whole.
        </p>

        <h3>Small Businesses</h3>
        <div>
            <p>This site will help small businesses whether they are just starting up or not. Our goal is to help with networking,
                exposure and advertising, enabling community involvement, and even providing free resources to help shape small 
                businesses from the ground up. We hope to be able to answer the following questions, among many more:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do I efficiently reach out to my target audience?</li>
                <li>How do I find the resources I need to start my own business?</li>
                <li>How do I find local events at which I can network and even market my business?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="persona">
                <h4>Meet Joe</h4>
                <h5><u>Biographical Information</u></h5>
                <p>Joe is 53 years old. He owns a beautiful flower shop with his sweet wife, which they built and now manage
                    together for 14 years. They have been doing well in this business.
                </p>
                <h5><u>Goals and Needs</u></h5>
                <p>His goal is to hire some additional employees to help out, as he and his wife are getting older and need more support. </p>
                <h5><u>How We Can Help</u></h5>
                <p>The Chamber can connect him with local accountants to help him set up and prepare for the tax considerations of hiring 
                    additional employees. He also gets connected with a health insurance broker who helps him get insurance benefits set up
                    for his employees. His friends at the Chamber also help him build his help wanted advertisements.
                </p>

        <h3>Non-Profit Organizations</h3>
        <div>
            <p>We also hope to enable the growth of non-profit organizations in our area. The same resources we we listed above are 
                available to non-profits. They will have immediate access to our network of businesses to be able to find their 
                target audience. We hope to be able to enable non-profits to have all the resources they need to adequately organize 
                local events and projects, which will in turn serve to strengthen our community as a whole. We hope to answer these
                questions and more:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can I get better exposure to raise more money for my non-profit?</li>
                <li>How can I use local businesses to quickly and effectively get the word out for my events?</li>
                <li>How can I find the right people to network with for my non-profit?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="persona">
                <h4>Meet Michelle</h4>
                <h5><u>Biographical Information</u></h5>
                <p>Michelle is starting a non-profit organization to support mothers with autistic children. She is a 42 year old mother of 
                    five, herself. She and her husband own a small business, which helps supply restaurants cash registers and other payment 
                    method machines and software.
                </p>
                <h5><u>Goals and Needs</u></h5>
                <p>Michelle wants to start this non-profit organization because she has an autistic child and understands that mothers with
                    autistic children need respite, resources and support. She is looking to organize a five-hour retreat on a Saturday for 
                    these mothers that will be completely free for them.
                </p>
                <h5><u>How We Can Help</u></h5>
                <p>The Chamber can help Michelle connect to business owners who are looking for tax deductions for charitable contributions
                    and special advertising opportunities. Small businesses such as restaurants could provide food at the retreat, salons 
                    could provide pampering and local botiques could provide small gifts and favors.
