            <p>Venngage, on their tutorial webpage that explains how to utilize white space and clean design,
                exemplify their own teachings. They use plenty of white space to show in what order the content
                should be viewed, and where the important things are. The layout is clean and not confusing for the
                who can easily navigate and find what they need, including the information for how to utilize white 
                space.

            <p>Build Redux is a computer building company. Their homepage shows little content, as the goal is
                to help the customer to get where they need to go: getting started on building a PC. There are a few
                navigation buttons at the top, but the two biggest choices on the screen are the start a custom build
                and to browse their best selling builds. If the user scrolls down they can see additional promotional
                content, but the main point of this webpage is very clear from the start: build a PC, please!

            <p>Darn Tough knows their socks are unique and interesting. To help highlight that fact, they
                designed their webpage in a way to call attention to their colorful footwear. They utilize white space 
                in conjunction with the contrasting colors of the socks and the promotional bar at the top of the screen
                so that the most important info is the first to draw attention and is easily seen and read.
